# Python-Flask-React-Boilerplate
A simple template for a fullstack web application using Python, Flask, React, Typescript, and Tailwind

## Proxy to the backend
Comes with a configured proxy to the backend, such that you can run the frontend server on port 3000, but still make requests to the backend on port 5000.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have Python installed. This project was built with 3.10 in mind, but any version of Python 3 should work.
2. Install frontend dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Install backend dependencies with `poetry install`
4. Run the backend server with `yarn start-server`
5. Run the frontend server with `yarn start`
